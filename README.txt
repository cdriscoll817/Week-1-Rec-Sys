directions for week1 project:
Most importantly, on line 51, the directory must be changed to where the ratings.csv file is stored on your computer. 
right now the getUserStats and getItemStats functions are commented out. uncomment these to see the answers to questions 3 & 4.
The other 3 functions are not commented out. getTotals will answer question 1. getRatingsTotals will answer question 5, and getDensity will answer question 2.
all functions display answers on command console when the program is run.
